## LaTeX Support Demo

As a data science and AI blog, mathematical equations are an essential part of our content. Here's a demonstration of our LaTeX support:

### Inline Equations

In physics, Einstein's famous mass-energy equivalence formula $E = mc^2$ revolutionized our understanding of the universe. Another common equation in data science is $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$ for calculating the mean.

### Display Equations

The quadratic formula is a classic example:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

### Complex Mathematical Notation

The probability density function of a normal distribution is given by:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

Here's a more complex example using various mathematical notations:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{e^{ix}}{x^2 + a^2} dx = \frac{\pi}{a}e^{-a} \quad (a > 0)$$

We can also write matrices:

$$\begin{bmatrix} 
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{bmatrix}$$

Thank you for being here, and I look forward to our interactions!
